# WiFi_Brute_force_connect
This script is a Python program that attempts to connect to a WiFi network using a list of passwords read from a file, with a user-specified SSID. It uses the Windows command-line 'netsh' utility and the 'keyboard' module to exit the script when 'Ctrl' key is pressed

This script appears to be a Python program that connects to a WiFi network using a list of passwords read from a file called "PASSWORD.txt" and the user-specified SSID (network name). The script uses the subprocess module to call the Windows command-line netsh utility, which is used to manage various network settings, including connecting to WiFi networks. The script also uses the keyring module to store the user-specified network password, so that it can be retrieved later. The script is in an infinite loop, which will keep trying to connect to the network until it is successful or an error is encountered. The try-except block is used to catch any errors that may occur during the connection process, and print a message to the user if an error occurs. The script uses the keyboard module to check if the 'Ctrl' key is pressed, and if it is, it will exit the script. The time module is used to add a delay of 60 seconds before trying to connect to the network again.
It reads the password from a file, then it will try to connect to the network using every password, one by one
